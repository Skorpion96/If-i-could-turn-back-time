# If i could turn back time (yes it's clearly a reference to Cher song)

Inspired by this gist (the reinstall_deb.sh almost) because i needed it and so i made them:https://gist.github.com/alberthdev/1834fc1fa0679f0671fe

A series of script to revert back the state of packages of a system, for example if you have damaged ones. This is a real thing that happened to me, while i was installing new software, sadly i removed what i shouldn't and it removed a lot of software destroying my system, while i was trying to revert i made things worse, this is when Dark and Cher vibes came in, i NEED to turn back time i tought, so i looked into something to reinstall my packages configuration, but it didn't work, so i tried to fix it, and so this series of scripts did born, and why not i introduced sound in, because it's cool.

These scripts reading your configuration restore: deb, flatpak, python and snaps, hope them will be useful!
